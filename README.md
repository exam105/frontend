### Welcome to the Exam105 Admin Application


## Mission Statement: 
    Exam105.com is a platform where the students and teachers will be able to get, search, and interact with the past papers of Cambridge Board Education System. It would provide its users with a lot of benefits. The users will be able to pick and chose from a wide range of papers conducted over the years, all the way from 2010, and make a customized pdf book to download and work with it however they may prefer; be it to prepare for the upcoming exams (from students' perspective), or to make new papers (from teachers' perspective). And as we progress, there would be more functionlities provided by the system in future.


The Exam105 Admin Application is made primarily for the purpose of managing the data that would be used in the exam105.com system. This application is bootstrapped with create-react-app. And the technologies it uses are listed down below.
